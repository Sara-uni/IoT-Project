# IoT Project

This project involves building an app to control and monitor an MSP432 microcontroller via Wi-Fi. Key features include tracking temperature, light intensity, noise levels, and controlling the LEDs on the MSP432.

Future enhancements include adding a user interface on the MSP432, integrating voice commands through Rasa for natural language processing, and controlling a smart light bulb based on environmental conditions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 12 or later) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS/macOS development)

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sara-uni/IoT-Project.git
   cd IoT-Project
   ```

2. Install dependecies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project

#### Running the App

To run the app on Android or iOS/macOS, use the following commands:

- **For Android**:

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the app using Vite
   - Sync with the Android platform using Capacitor
   - Open Android Studio for further testing and running

- **For iOS/macOS**:

   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the app using Vite
   - Sync with the iOS platform using Capacitor
   - Open Xcode for testing and deployment on a device or simulator

#### Running Rasa server

To install the necessary dependency and run the rasa server used to respond to the user vocal commands there are this prerequisite:
- have python installed (ATTENTION: version 3.10.x is required, newer version have conflicts with some dependencies)
- have pip installed and updated (use the command "pip install --upgrade pip")

Installation procedure
- move in the "rasa-server" folder and run the following command to create the virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv rasa-venv
```
- run the following commands to enter the virtual environment and install rasa with the necessary dependecies
```bash
source venv/bin/activate                                                                                           ✔  3s  
pip install rasa
```
